# ChildPedia
An Encyclopedia for Children

This is an app that children can use to make their own encyclopedia and share it to the other user.

Childpedia_Endpoint folder contains the endpoint code using Python Language and flask. The endpoint is used to connect the application to Bigquery and Cloud Storage on GCP (Google Cloud Platform). Because some of our members are also busy with other works unrelated to Capstone Project, unfortunately we don't have time to properly integrate the endpoint with the Childpedia App. So, as of right now the Childpedia app cannot connect to Bigquery and Cloud Storage.
